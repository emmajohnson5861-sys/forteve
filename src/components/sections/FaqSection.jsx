      "Our typical process includes Discovery, UX research, information architecture, wireframing, UI design, prototyping, development, QA and launch. Throughout the project, you'll have full visibility into progress, regular design reviews and direct communication with our team.",
      "Whether it's a landing page or a large enterprise platform, our goal is always the same: create a website that looks exceptional, performs flawlessly and helps your business grow.",

      'We offer end-to-end digital design and development services, allowing our clients to work with a single experienced team from strategy to launch.',
      'Depending on your needs, we can help with brand identity, UX research, product strategy, user experience design, interface design, motion design, frontend and backend development, CMS implementation, performance optimization and ongoing support.',

      'Both. We choose the technology based on your business goals rather than forcing every project into the same stack.',
      'For marketing websites that require easy content management and fast delivery, Webflow can be a great solution. For more complex products, custom interactions, advanced animations, CMS integrations or scalable platforms, we usually build custom websites using modern technologies like Astro, Next.js, React, GSAP and headless CMS solutions such as Strapi.',

    question: 'Can you help launch an MVP quickly?',
    paragraphs: [
      "Absolutely. We've helped startups launch MVPs within just a few months by focusing on what matters most: validating the product idea instead of building every possible feature.",
      'Our team works closely with founders to define the minimum feature set, prioritize user flows and create a polished product that is ready for investors, early adopters or market testing.',

      'For simple marketing websites, platforms like Webflow or WordPress can work well. For more complex websites and digital products, we often recommend headless CMS solutions like Strapi, which provide greater flexibility, performance and long-term scalability.',

  {
    question: 'My website has poor PageSpeed scores. Can you help improve them?',
    paragraphs: [
      'Absolutely. Low PageSpeed scores are usually caused by a combination of factors rather than a single issue. We begin with a technical audit to identify bottlenecks such as unoptimized images, excessive JavaScript, render-blocking resources, inefficient third-party scripts, poor caching or server configuration.',
      'Based on our findings, we optimize both the frontend and backend, improve loading strategies, implement modern image formats, reduce unnecessary code, fine-tune Core Web Vitals and configure CDN and caching where appropriate.',
